When using [event templating](./templating#event-templating), you might end up with various event heights, depending on the displayed content, e.g. larger description, list of tasks, etc.
By default this might not show up correctly, resulting in events overlapping each other.

You can enable support for variable event heights by setting the `eventHeight: 'variable'` property for the timeline inside the [`view`](#opt-view) option.
This will enable a new rendering mode. In this mode, in case of large views, where virtual scrolling is used, initially the height of the rows which are not visible, is only estimated,
and will be updated during scroll, as new rows, columns and events are rendered in the view. This will result in visible size changes of the scrollbar during vertical scroll,
or changes in the row heights during horizontal scroll, as new events are rendered in the view.

:::caution
Using variable event heights is currently experimental.

While we tested a lot of configurations and use cases, there might be specific view configurations or event layouts causing problems,
like events appearing over each other, rows not expanding correctly to fit the events, jumps during scroll or during drag & drop.

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

**1.** To install the luxon library with npm you will need to run the following commands:

```bash
npm install luxon
```

In case you are using typescript you can also consider installing the types, because they come separately:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/luxon
```

**2.** After the library is installed, you will have to import it with the `luxonTimezone` object from mobiscroll:

<CodeBlock language="javascript" title="Luxon library import">
import * as luxon from 'luxon';{'\n'}
import {'\{'} luxonTimezone {'\}'} from '@mobiscroll/{props.framework}';
</CodeBlock>

**3.** Then set the mobiscroll's reference to the imported library:

<CodeBlock language="javascript" title="Luxon library setup">
import * as luxon from 'luxon';{'\n'}
import {'\{'} luxonTimezone {'\}'} from '@mobiscroll/{props.framework}';{'\n'}
// highlight-next-line{'\n'}
luxonTimezone.luxon = luxon;
</CodeBlock>

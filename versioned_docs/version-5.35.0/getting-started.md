# Welcome to the Mobiscroll Docs

Mobiscroll is a collection of UI components that helps deliver great mobile apps, websites with a great user experience and in getting five-star app store reviews. The controls follow platform UX guidelines and can be customized for a perfect fit.

## Frameworks

Mobiscroll can be integrated into many ecosystems, all of which might fall into one of the 5 officially supported ones. We call these ecosystems **frameworks** in this documentation but in a narrow sense of the word not all of these are actually javascript frameworks.

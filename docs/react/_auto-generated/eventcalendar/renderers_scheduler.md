The following event specific properties are available:

- `id`: _string_ - The id of the event.
- `isMultiDay`: _boolean_ - True if the event spans across multiple days.
- `lastDay`: _boolean_ - True if it&#039;s rendered on the last day of a multiple event.
- `original`: _MbscCalendarEvent_ - The original event object.
- `start`: _string_ - The formatted start time, if the event is not all day.

**Default value**: `undefined`

### renderResource {#renderer-renderResource}

(resource: [MbscResource](#type-MbscResource), day: Date) => any

The following properties are available:

### renderSchedulerDay {#renderer-renderSchedulerDay}

(args: MbscCalendarDayData) => any

If you are looking to customize only the day cells content and don&#039;t want to bother with the styling of the cells,
use the [renderSchedulerDayContent](#renderer-renderSchedulerDayContent) option.

when the events are grouped by resources.

**Default value**: `undefined`

### renderSchedulerDayContent {#renderer-renderSchedulerDayContent}

(args: MbscCalendarDayData) => any


Customize the day cells content of the scheduler view. The Eventcalendar will take care of the styling and you can focus on
what you show beside the day number.

If you are looking to fully customize the day (e.g. add custom hover effects) you will need to use the
[renderSchedulerDay](#renderer-renderSchedulerDay) option.

but everything else (like background color, hover effect, etc.) is left to you.

If you are looking to customize only the content (e.g. add custom elements) and don&#039;t want to bother with the styling of the event,
you can use the [renderSchedulerEventContent](#renderer-renderSchedulerEventContent) option.

Some of the event specific details are computed, but there is also a reference to the **original** event they come from.
The following event specific properties are available:
- `allDay`: _string_ - The localized all-day text in case of all day events.

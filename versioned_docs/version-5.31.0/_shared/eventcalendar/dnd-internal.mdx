Calendar events can be created, moved and resized on the Eventcalendar. Furthermore it is possible to drag and drop events from an external source or to drag and drop to an external target from the Eventcalendar. The following sections describe how these solutions can be implemented and used.

## Internal drag/resize/create

The events on the Eventcalendar can be moved and resized with mouse/touch interactions. The [`dragToMove`](./api#opt-dragToMove) and [`dragToResize`](./api#opt-dragToResize) options enable the events drag and drop and resize functionality. With the [`dragTimeStep`](./api#opt-dragTimeStep) option the minimum amount of drag/resize step can be specified in minutes.

With the [`dragToCreate`](./api#opt-dragToCreate) option enabled, events can be created by dragging on the empty areas of the Eventcalendar. On a desktop environment a new event can also be created with the [`clickToCreate`](./api#opt-clickToCreate) option.

To customize the newly created event use the [`extendDefaultEvent`](./api#opt-extendDefaultEvent) option.

## Targeting the Eventcalendar

There is a possibility to drag & drop any external element into your calendar.

In order to achieve this, first you need to grant permission to your calendar to accept this behavior. You can do that by setting the [`externalDrop`](./api#opt-externalDrop) option to `true`.

As a second step, you'll have to create your external draggable element and pass a skeleton event definition through the `dragData` option which will be added to the Eventcalendar on drop. If omitted, a default event will be created.

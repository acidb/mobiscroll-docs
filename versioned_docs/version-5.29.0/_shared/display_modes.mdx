The component supports five display modes that specify where on the screen is it going to render itself:

1. `'center'` - will render the Datepicker on the center of the screen
2. `'top'` - will render the Datepicker on the top of the screen sliding down
3. `'bottom'` - will render the Datepicker on the bottom of the screen sliding up
4. `'anchored'` - will render the Datepicker above or below the element it is anchored to. The [`anchor`](./api#opt-anchor) option will specify the element to which the Datepicker is positioned. By default it is the input element rendered by the datepicker.
5. `'inline'` - will render the Datepicker into the page embedded.

Additionally to the display option, the picker also takes into consideration the environment, whether it is used on mobile or a desktop device. This is represented by the [`touchUi`](./api#opt-touchUi) option and by default it is set to automatically detect the environment.

:::info
The default buttons that appear on the picker depend on the display mode and touchUi option. It also determins if the picker operates in [live selection](./live-selection) or not.

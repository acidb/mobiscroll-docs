### cssClass {#opt-cssClass}

string

Specifies a custom CSS class for the component.

**Default value**: `undefined`
### element {#opt-element}

null &#124; HTMLElement


### responsive {#opt-responsive}

[MbscResponsiveOptions&lt;any&gt;](#type-MbscResponsiveOptions)

Specifies different options for different container widths, in a form of an object,
where the keys are the name of the breakpoints, and the values are objects containing the options for the given breakpoint.

:::info
The available width is queried from the container element of the component and not the browsers viewport like in css media queries
:::
There are five predefined breakpoints:

- `xsmall` - min-width: 0px
- `small` - min-width: 576px
- `medium` - min-width: 768px
- `large` - min-width: 992px
- `xlarge` - min-width: 1200px

Custom breakpoints can be defined by passing an object containing the `breakpoint` property specifying the min-width in pixels.
Example:

```
responsive: {
  small: {
    display: 'bottom'
  },
  custom: { // Custom breakpoint, you can use multiple if needed, but each must have a unique name.
    breakpoint: 600,
    display: 'center'
  },
  large: {
    display: 'anchored'
  }
}
```

**Default value**: `undefined`
### theme {#opt-theme}

string

Specifies the visual appearance of the component.

If it is `'auto'` or `undefined`, the theme will automatically be chosen based on the platform.
If custom themes are also present, they will take precedence over the built in themes, e.g. if there&#039;s an iOS based custom theme,
it will be chosen on the iOS platform instead of the default iOS theme.

Supplied themes:
- `'ios'` - iOS theme
- `'material'` - Material theme
- `'windows'` - Windows theme

It&#039;s possible to [modify theme colors](../theming/sass-variables) or
[create custom themes](../theming/sass-themes).

:::info
Make sure that the theme you set is included in the downloaded package.
:::

**Default value**: `undefined`
### themeVariant {#opt-themeVariant}

"light" &#124; "dark" &#124; "auto"

Controls which variant of the [theme](#opt-theme) will be used (light or dark).

Possible values:
- `'light'` - Use the light variant of the theme.
- `'dark'` - Use the dark variant of the theme.
- `'auto'` or `undefined` - Detect the preferred system theme on devices where this is supported.

To use the option with custom themes, make sure to create two custom themes, where the dark version has the same name as the light one,
suffixed with `'-dark'`, e.g.: `'my-theme'` and `'my-theme-dark'`.

**Default value**: `undefined`

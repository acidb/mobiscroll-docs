By default the Datepicker uses the local timezone of the browser for value selection. If you want to select a date-time in a different timezone, you will need an external library to handle the timezone conversions. There are two libraries that Mobiscroll supports: [moment-timezone](https://momentjs.com/timezone/) and [luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/).

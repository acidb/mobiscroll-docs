Start a free trial by entering your email address on the [Mobiscroll homepage](https://mobiscroll.com) and create your account. When asked, enter your first name, set a password and you're ready to go!

### This is how the free trial works:
1. You can try Mobiscroll for free.
2. The trial needs an active connection to Mobiscroll servers for validation. Don't worry, the licensed product will work offline with downloadable resource files.
Read about the [differences between trial and licensed products](http://help.mobiscroll.com/trials/what-are-the-limitations-of-the-trial).
3. You can upgrade to the licensed product at any time during or after your trial.

### Installing a trial package

To install the Mobiscroll Trial, you will need to open a terminal window in the root folder of you project and run the following command:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
mobiscroll config {props.framework} --trial
</CodeBlock>

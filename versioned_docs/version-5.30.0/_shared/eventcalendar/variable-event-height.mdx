When using [event templating](./templating#event-templating), you might end up with various event heights, depending on the displayed content, e.g. larger description, list of tasks, etc.
By default this might not show up correctly, resulting in events overlapping each other.

You can enable support for variable event heights by setting the `eventHeight: 'variable'` property for the timeline inside the [`view`](./api#opt-view) option.
This will enable a new rendering mode. In case of large views, where virtual scrolling is used, the height of the rows might change dynamically
as new events are loaded into the view during scroll.

:::info
Support for variable event heights is an experimental feature and it's not enabled by default. If you're working with variable event heights
you can enable this mode and [let us know if you find any problems](https://mobiscroll.com/account/supporttickets).

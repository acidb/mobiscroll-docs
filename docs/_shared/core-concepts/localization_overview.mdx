## Overview

The Mobiscroll components offer comprehensive localization features, ensuring they can be seamlessly integrated into any project worldwide. 

These features include:
- the ability to format [dates](../core-concepts/localization#localization-dateFormat) and [times](../core-concepts/localization#localization-timeFormat) according to regional preferences 
- the components allow for the customization of [button labels](../core-concepts/localization#localization-todayText) and other [interface text](../core-concepts/localization#localization-moreEventsText), making it easy to translate these elements into any language 
- [support for right-to-left (RTL) text direction](../core-concepts/localization#localization-rtl), which is essential for languages like Arabic and Hebrew

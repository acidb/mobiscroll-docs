When focusing the input component rendered, one can open the Select using the Space or Enter keys.

The `Tab` and `Shift + Tab` keys can be used for navigating between the rendered wheels if there are multiple wheels available (for example having a group wheel). Also if there is a filter input or there are buttons rendered, the same keys will cycle through them too.

The `Up` and `Down` arrow keys can be used to focus wheelitems in desktop mode with the `Space` key to select the item. In mobile mode the arrow keys rotate the wheel so that automatically changes the selection.

The `Enter` key can be used to confirm the selection and close the picker, while the `Esc` key will act as a cancel action (also closing the Select component).

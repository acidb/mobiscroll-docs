## Keyboard Support

The Eventcalendar supports different [views](./api#opt-view) for different jobs and each of these views support keyboard navigation.

Focus can be moved with the `Tab` key. Focusable elements depend on the displayed view (more details below).

Buttons can be triggered using the `Space` key when focused.

Rendered events act like buttons. When an event is focused, the [event click](./api#event-onEventClick) event can be triggered using the `Space` or `Enter` keys.

### Calendar view

Focusable elements are:

* the header buttons: navigation, prev, next and today buttons
* the events rendered on the calendar view
* the currently selected day

When the selected day is focused, the focus can be moved using the `Up`, `Down`, `Left` and `Right` arrow keys and set with the `Space` or `Enter` keys.

When the popover is enabled on events, it can be toggled using the `Space` and `Esc` keys.

On the [download page](https://download.mobiscroll.com/) a custom package can be built by picking only the components, themes, languages and additional modules you need.

When [building your package](http://help.mobiscroll.com/en/articles/974201-download-builder), select the required components and other resources, then hit the download button.

**1. Copy Mobiscroll into your app**

Extract the zip file you just downloaded, then grab the `js`, `src` and `css` folders and copy it into src/lib/mobiscroll folder of your JavaScript app. If there is no such folder available, you can create it.

**2. Run the config command**

Run the config command in the root folder of your app in a terminal window.

<CodeBlock language="bash">
mobiscroll config {props.framework} --no-npm
</CodeBlock>

# Welcome to the Mobiscroll Docs

Mobiscroll is a collection of UI components that helps deliver great mobile apps, websites with a great user experience and in getting five-star app store reviews. The controls follow platform UX guidelines and can be customized for a perfect fit.

## Frameworks

Mobiscroll can be integrated into many ecosystems, all of which might fall into one of the 5 officially supported ones. We call these ecosystems **frameworks** in this documentation but in a narrow sense of the word not all of these are actually javascript frameworks.

## Mobiscroll Connect

Mobiscroll Connect is an API service and sync engine that acts as a bridge between users' calendars (Google, Outlook, iCloud) and your app. It acts as a full-fledged OAuth 2.0 provider, enabling seamless integration with multiple calendar providers through a unified interface. Mobiscroll Connect handles authentication, provider selection, and consent management, exposing a standardized API for securely accessing calendar data.

When your Mobiscroll package is created with the [Download Builder](https://download.mobiscroll.com) and you have access to the Calendar Integration, you can choose to include it in the built package. In this case you will need to make sure you checked the Calendar Integration before downloading the package from the download page. After installing your downloaded package, the Calendar Integration will be available for import.

When you're using the full Mobiscroll package from NPM, then you have the possibility to install the Calendar Integration as an additional package (also from NPM). In this case, after successfully using the [Mobiscroll CLI](https://docs.mobiscroll.com/cli) to configure the project, you will have to install the `@mobiscroll/calendar-integration` package from npm. Use the following command:

```bash
npm install @mobiscroll/calendar-integration
```

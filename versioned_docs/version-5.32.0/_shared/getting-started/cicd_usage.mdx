The config command will create a file named `.npmrc` in the project root, containing the access tokens to the Mobiscroll NPM registry. Commit this file into the repository to ensure the package will install for other team members and in CI/CD environments.

When used with Yarn 2 or 3, a different file is used, named `.yarnrc.yml`. Make sure this is also added to the repository.

When used with Docker, make sure to copy the `.npmrc` or `.yarnrc.yml` file together with `package.json`, to make sure that the install process will have access to the Mobiscroll NPM registry. 

Here's a Dockerfile example:

```bash
FROM node:18.12.0 as build

ENV NODE_ENV production

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json package-lock.json .npmrc ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

# ...
```

:::info 
It is recommended to set up and use [team NPM accounts](http://help.mobiscroll.com/en/articles/8095168-team-npm-accounts) instead of individual developer credentials for installing Mobiscroll.

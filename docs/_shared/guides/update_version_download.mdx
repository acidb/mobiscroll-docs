After that, create a folder with the following path `src/lib/mobiscroll` from your projects root directory.
Copy the `src`, `js`, `css`, `esm5` folders from the temp folder to your project's `src/lib/mobiscroll` folder you created.

#### 3. Run the config command

Running the following command will update the package in your project:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
mobiscroll config {props.framework} --no-npm
</CodeBlock>

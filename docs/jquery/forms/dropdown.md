# Dropdown

The Dropdown component can be used for collecting user provided information from a set of options. It uses the HTML select element and adds custom styling and additional functionality.

## Usage

Use the [`label`](#opt-label) option to provide a label to the dropdown.

All the options can be passed to the dropdown via `data-` attributes with one exception. The exception is the `disabled` attribute, that don't need the data- prefix, since the native select supports it.

```html
<label>
    <select data-label="Choose one" mbsc-dropdown id="choose">
        <option>Option 1</option>
        <option>Option 2</option>
        <option>Option 3</option>
    </select>
</label>
```

## Auto vs. manual initialization

If the component is added later to the DOM, e.g. with an AJAX page load, a custom function named `enhance` needs to be called in order to initialize the dynamically added component. When the enhance function is called on a DOM element, all form elements will be initialized inside this element.

```js
$.get('/myform', function (responseHtml) {
    var $page = $('#page');
    $page.html(responseHtml);
    // highlight-next-line
    mobiscroll.enhance($page[0]);
});
```

<div className="option-list">

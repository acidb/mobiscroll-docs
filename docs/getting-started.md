## Upgrade from trial

### Acquiring a license

When upgrading from a trial license to a commercial, the first step is to purchase the commercial license. This can be done from our [pricing page](https://mobiscroll.com/pricing) among other areas of our website.
If you are still looking for which license to choose or if you have any questions, let us know! We are here to help!

### Assigning the license to the developer

After the purchase of the commercial license, it should be assigned to the developer, who will do the development. This can be done immediately after the purchase, or later from the [licenses page](https://mobiscroll.com/account/licenses) among. When the buyer and the developer is the same person, the license can be self-assigned as well.
